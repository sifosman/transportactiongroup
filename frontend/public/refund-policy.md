Refund & Cancellation Policy
We want learners to have a great experience. If something isn’t right, please contact us so we can help.
How to request a refund
Email support@transportactiongroup.com with your order number, course name, and a short note explaining the issue. We’ll reply within 2 business days.
Eligibility (individual purchases)
•	7-day window: You may request a full refund within 7 calendar days of purchase if you have not completed the course and no certificate has been issued.
•	Not eligible: Refunds aren’t available once a certificate is issued, or a final assessment is completed.
•	Technical issues: If you can’t access the course due to a platform error, we’ll fix access or issue a refund regardless of progress.
Eligibility (organizational/bulk seats)
•	Before activation: Full refund within 14 days of purchase if seats haven’t been activated (no learners enrolled). 
•	After activation: Within 7 days of activation, unused seats are refundable; started seats (learner viewed ≥20% or completed an assessment) are not refundable. Bulk discounts will be reversed and seats used will be billed at individual rates.
•	Seat transfers: Organizations may reassign unused seats at any time within the license period.
What we refund to
Approved refunds are returned to the original payment method only. After we issue the refund, banks/card networks typically show funds within 5–10 business days. Timing can vary by bank.
Partial refunds & price adjustments
For individuals, if a discount was applied at purchase, any refund reflects the discounted price paid. We may offer partial refunds case-by-case for bundles or multi-course purchases. For groups, any refund will be calculated based on the used seats charged at individual rates.
Cancellations (subscriptions, if applicable)
You can cancel any ongoing subscription in your account settings or by emailing support. Cancellation stops future charges. Unless required by law, past charges aren’t refundable, but you retain access until the end of the billing period.
Chargebacks & disputes
Please contact us first as we can usually resolve issues faster than a bank dispute and with less hassle for you. We keep proof of policy acceptance at checkout to help resolve any disputes professionally.
